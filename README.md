# Worksheet Generator

## Purpose
The Worksheet Generator app is to rapidly generate worksheets for additions, subtractions, multiplications or divisions.

## Usage
1. Fill in a minimum value and maximum value for the numbers that will generate the sums.
2. Select the operand from +, -, ร, รท, or `All` for a combination
E.g. if you put in a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 10 with the operand `+`, you will get sums adding a number from one to ten to another number from one to ten.

    NOTE: Divide and multiply questions can be restricted to questions from the 1 to 12 times tables and equivalent division tables using the `Restrict multiplication questions` and `Restrict division question` checkboxes.

3. Enter the number of questions the worksheet will have.
    - The total number of questions is restricted to 28 since this fits onto 1 page.
4. Click `GENERATE WORKSHEET`. A worksheet will be generated which can then be printed via your browser's usual print functionality (can be accessed by clicking `PRINT`).

    NOTE: the printouts work best printed from Chrome or Edge.

## Adding additional sections
- If you wish, you can add sections to the form that generates the worksheet, this allows you to for example, generate a section of addition questions for numbers up to 5, a section for subtraction for numbers up to 10, etc. Click `ADD SECTION` to add a blank section row.
- If you wish to remove a section, click the `DELETE` button for that section.
- To start again, click `CLEAR`.

## Including a custom question
- The `Include space at the end of the worksheet for a custom question` checkbox allows you to add a custom question in the worksheet.
    - When checked you can either type into the text box provided or leave the box blank if you want to hand write a question into an empty space on the worksheet.
        - You can also enter the answer for the question into the `The answer is` box,
    - When checked the maximum number of questions will be 21 (inclusive of the custom question).

- The `Display confused person image` checkbox indicates if you want a daft graphic of a person scratching his head included on the worksheet.

## Answer sheet
- When the worksheet is generated an answer sheet is also generated.
- Control whether the answer sheet prints or not using the browser's print dialog options.
